📊 Random Variables and Probability Distributions
This notebook provides a concise explanation and classification of random variables—key concepts in probability and statistics. It includes both theoretical notes and Python-based demonstrations of major probability distributions.

🧠 Contents Covered
Random Variables:

Discrete: Bernoulli, Binomial, Negative Binomial, Poisson

Continuous: Uniform, Normal (Gaussian), Exponential

Mathematical Formulas:

Probability Density/Mass Functions

Parameters for each distribution (e.g., mean, variance)

Expectation, Variance, and Standard Deviation

Python Implementation:

Simulation and visualization of the above distributions using libraries like matplotlib, numpy, and scipy.stats

📌 Applications
Understanding distributions is fundamental for:

Data analysis

Statistical inference

Machine learning model assumptions

Simulations in research and applied domains
